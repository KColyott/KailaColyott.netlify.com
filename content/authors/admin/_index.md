Kaila L. Colyott is a PhD Candidate in Evolutionary Biology and Program Coordinator at the Center for Teaching Excellence at University of Kansas. Her PhD work focuses on integrating behavior, genetics, and phylogenetics to better understand the evolution of sexual signals. In her teaching, she has a broad portfolio of working with underrepresented groups and creating active learning environments that benefit students from all backgrounds. Kaila has a sustained personal commitment to communities that are underrepresented in the academy through both undergraduate research mentorship and science outreach engagement. 

In her role at the Center for Teaching Excellence, Kaila coordinates programs that foster teaching excellence and innovation in faculty and graduate teaching assistants. This includes coordinating logistics for a multi-university project aimed at improving the evaluation of teaching funded by National Science Foundation. She also plans and implements programs to support improved teaching and community building opportunities for GTAs across campus.

After completing her Ph.D., she aspires to build a career that will allow her to continue growing in the field of education while also participating in the scientific research process. Kaila hopes to use her data analytics skills and passion for inclusive pedagogy to continue contributing to the fields of science and education.
